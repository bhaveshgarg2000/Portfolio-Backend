    <h4>Introduction : -</h4>
    <p>
      Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime
      environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code
      outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write
      command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts
      server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to
      the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript
      everywhere" paradigm unifying web-application development around a single
      programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and
      client-side scripts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though .js is the standard filename extension for JavaScript code, the
      name "Node.js" doesn't refer to a particular file in this context and is
      merely the name of the product. Node.js has an event-driven architecture
      capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize
      throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output
      operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time
      communication programs and browser games).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the
      Node.js Foundation, and has now merged with the JS Foundation to form the
      OpenJS Foundation, which is facilitated by the Linux Foundation's
      Collaborative Projects program
    </p>

    <h4>Overview : -</h4>
    <p>
      Node.js allows the creation of Web servers and networking tools using
      JavaScript and a collection of "modules" that handle various core
      functionalities. Modules are provided for file system I/O, networking
      (DNS, HTTP, TCP, TLS/SSL, or UDP), binary data (buffers), cryptography
      functions, data streams, and other core functions. Node.js's modules use
      an API designed to reduce the complexity of writing server applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript is the only language that Node.js supports natively, but many
      compile-to-JS languages are available. As a result, Node.js applications
      can be written in CoffeeScript, Dart, TypeScript, ClojureScript and
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Node.js is primarily used to build network programs such as Web servers.
      The most significant difference between Node.js and PHP is that most
      functions in PHP block until completion (commands execute only after
      previous commands finish), while Node.js functions are non-blocking
      (commands execute concurrently or even in parallel, and use callbacks to
      signal completion or failure).
    </p>
    <p>
      Node.js is officially supported on Linux, macOS and Microsoft Windows 8.1
      and Server 2012 (and later), with tier 2 support for SmartOS and IBM AIX
      and experimental support for FreeBSD. OpenBSD also works, and LTS versions
      available for IBM i (AS/400). The provided source code may also be built
      on similar operating systems to those officially supported or be modified
      by third parties to support others such as NonStop OS and Unix servers.
    </p>
    <h4>Features of Node.js : -</h4>
    <p>
      Following are some of the important features that make Node.js the first
      choice of software architects.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h5>Asynchronous and Event Driven −</h5>
        All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, that is, non-blocking. It
        essentially means a Node.js based server never waits for an API to
        return data. The server moves to the next API after calling it and a
        notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps the server to get a
        response from the previous API call.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Very Fast −</h5>
        Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is
        very fast in code execution.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Single Threaded but Highly Scalable −</h5>
        Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. Event mechanism
        helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way and makes the server
        highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create limited
        threads to handle requests. Node.js uses a single threaded program and
        the same program can provide service to a much larger number of requests
        than traditional servers like Apache HTTP Server.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>No Buffering −</h5>
        Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply
        output the data in chunks.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>License −</h5>
        Node.js is released under the MIT license
      </li>

     <h3> 1. WHAT IS NODEJS?   </h3>

      <p>
        Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime
        environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code
        outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write
        command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts
        server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent
        to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a
        "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application
        development around a single programming language, rather than different
        languages for server-side and client-side scripts.
      </p>

    <h3> 2. WHAT ARE THE APPLICATIONS OF NODEJS?   </h3> 

      <p>
        Node allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a
        computer process itself instead of in a browser. Node can, therefore, be
        used to write server-side applications with access to the operating
        system, file system, and everything else required to build
        fully-functional applications. Companies that use Node.js know that
        JavaScript is the go-to language for building dynamic websites. But they
        want to take their dedication to JavaScript just a step further by
        utilizing the language not only for front-end development, but back-end
        development too. Node.js is a platform many skilled web developers are
        using today to amp up their back-end development while still using the
        same tried-and-true language – JavaScript. In fact, Node.js is so
        popular, quite a few major business enterprises are well-acquainted with
        the software.

       <h3> 3.	COMPARISON OF NODE JS WITH OTHER SERVERS WITH JPS AND ASP?   </h3> 
            <p>
                            JavaScript’s rising popularity has brought with it a lot of changes, and the face of web development today is dramatically different. <br>
                             The things that we can do on the web nowadays with JavaScript running on the server, as well as in the browser, were hard to imagine just several years ago, or were encapsulated within sandboxed environments like Flash or Java Applets.
                            <br> Before digging into Node.js solutions, you might want to read up on the benefits of using JavaScript across the stack which unifies the language and data format (JSON), allowing you to optimally reuse developer resources.
                            <br> As this is more a benefit of JavaScript than Node.js specifically, we won’t discuss it much here. But it’s a key advantage to incorporating Node in your stack.
                           <br>  As Wikipedia states: “Node.js is a packaged compilation of Google’s V8 JavaScript engine, the libuv platform abstraction layer, and a core library, which is itself primarily written in JavaScript.” Beyond that, it’s worth noting that Ryan Dahl, the creator of Node.js, was aiming to create real-time websites with push capability, “inspired by applications like Gmail”.
                          <br>  In Node.js, he gave developers a tool for working in the non-blocking, event-driven I/O paradigm.
                                 </p>




<h3>        4. What Are the Advantages of Node.js?  </h3>


<p>



    Node.js is used by some of the most popular companies today. With that kind of track record, you have to wonder what makes Node.js so desirable. 
    Below are some advantages of Node.js.
                                            <center style=" font-size:30px">  <u> <i> Easy  </i> </u>  </center>
Node.js is easy to learn. Though you’ll want professional developers to help you work on the software for your business, accessibility plays a large role in why developers choose to learn Node.js in the first place. Previous mastery of JavaScript and object-oriented programming is a must. And that requires seasoned developers. But after surpassing that threshold, developers will be relieved to know they can start doing what they came here for – programming.



                                                      <center style=" font-size:30px"> <u> <i> SIMPLE </i> </u>  </center>
Because Node.js is a fan of the ‘JavaScript everywhere’ paradigm, there is no need to switch programming languages between back-end and front-end development. 
Most programming projects use tech stacks that require 2-4 different programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and whatever else to account for a variety of development needs including databases, front-end development, and back-end development. 
Node.js allows for only one language to be the primary catalyst for full-stack development.
 In effect, this leads to fewer files, less code, and overall less complication.
                                                             <center style=" font-size:30px">   <u> <i>   Fast  </i> </u>  </center>
Projects built using Node.js hit the market at a faster rate than otherwise. Node.js is lightweight. As a result, programming in the Node.js environment is faster and easier. Ultimately, this reduces the time spent in development and the overall time-to-market. Businesses look at faster release times advantageously. This is because they can get immediate feedback and make meaningful updates. Such an advantage is also helpful for developing a minimum viable product (MVP) to test Node.js project ideas on the market. Websites that use Node.js tend to be faster as well.
Scalable
One of the reasons Node.js was made is to offer a more scalable alternative to Apache.Therefore, scalability is built into the very heart of Node.js. Companies that use Node.js have a need for scalable software in order to plan for business growth. Node.js can handle several concurrent connections. Another useful feature of Node.js is load balancing which is the process of distributing tasks competently amongst resources. This occurs when the load balancer receives incoming requests and sends them off to the server most capable of fulfilling them.software often has the largest communities. The benefit of a large community is lots of support and feedback.
This same community takes full advantage of the open-source standing of Node.js, building tools to ease the development process for everybody.
Node package manager (NPM) the official package ecosystem for Node.js is the largest and fastest-growing software registry in the world.
